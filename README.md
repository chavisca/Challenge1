# <Challenge1_CC>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is meant to demonstrate the ability to refactor: take existing code and improve it without changing its core functions.
This project is also meant to demonstrate the inclusion of accessibility via code.
These skills are important to junior developers.  Refactoring is a common ask and accessibility improves the user experience for those that use assistance tools while also improving the search engine positioning.
By implementing alt attributes into the image elements, additional accessibility is created.
