# Refactor for Accessibility

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the ability to refactor: take existing code and improve it without changing its core functions.
This project is also meant to demonstrate the inclusion of accessibility via code.
These skills are important to junior developers.  Refactoring is a common ask and adding quality comments to the code and providing organized code structure is useful for any reviewers or future refactoring.  
Accessibility improves the user experience for those that use assistance tools while also improving the search engine positioning.
By implementing alt attributes into the image elements, additional accessibility is created.
This was a useful exercise in updating existing code, notably removing containers and adding semantic elements and updating the corresponding stylesheet targets.

## Tests

1.  To test the alt attributes, I changed the pathing of the image sources to "break" them and forced the site to not render the image to review the alt text that should display instead.  
2.  The changes to the title are readily visible when changed and ther site is refreshed.  
3.  Replacing the div and span tags with the appropriate semantic tags required multiple refreshes to make sure the website rendered as it did originally; this includes review of the CSS stylesheet and updating of targets there.
